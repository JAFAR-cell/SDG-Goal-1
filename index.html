        <h2>About Poverty</h2>
        <p>Poverty affects millions worldwide. Learn about its causes and impact.</p>
        <p>Extreme poverty is defined as living on less than $1.90 a day, a reality for over 700 million people globally. This means lack of access to basic needs such as food, clean water, and shelter.</p>
        <p>Factors contributing to poverty include unemployment, social inequality, and lack of access to quality education. Addressing these root causes is essential for sustainable solutions.</p>

                <h3>Global Impact</h3>
                <p>Over 700 million people live on less than $1.90 a day. This represents nearly 10% of the global population. The majority of these individuals reside in developing regions, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Poverty also exacerbates other issues like malnutrition, lack of access to healthcare, and vulnerability to climate-related disasters. Tackling global poverty requires coordinated efforts across nations and sectors to ensure equitable development and inclusion.</p>

                <h3>Children in Poverty</h3>
                <p>1 in 5 children globally live in extreme poverty. This harsh reality deprives them of basic rights, including access to education, healthcare, and proper nutrition. Malnutrition is particularly devastating, leading to stunted growth and long-term health complications. Without intervention, children born into poverty often remain trapped in the cycle for generations. Programs focused on child welfare, such as school meal initiatives and healthcare accessibility, play a pivotal role in breaking this cycle and offering hope for a better future.</p>

            <h3>John's Journey</h3>
            <p>John was once trapped in the cycle of poverty, struggling to make ends meet. Living in a small, impoverished community, he faced numerous challenges—lack of access to education, limited job opportunities, and a harsh environment. However, everything changed when he was introduced to a local community program focused on education and skill development.</p>
            <p>Through this program, John was able to gain essential skills in carpentry and business management. He also received mentorship from individuals who had successfully turned their lives around. With newfound confidence and training, John started his own carpentry business. His business grew steadily, and he was able to employ others in his community, providing jobs and stability. John’s success story is a testament to the transformative power of education and support in breaking the cycle of poverty.</p>
